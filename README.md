## Group 4 Project 1: Overview of Net Migration, Economic Freedom, and GDP

This project explores the relationship between net migration, economic freedom, and GDP across various countries over time. By analyzing migration patterns and their interplay with economic factors, we aim to uncover insights into how these elements influence one another.

## Objective
Our primary objective is to examine how migration patterns are affected by a country’s economic freedom and GDP. Specifically, we aim to:

- Determine whether economic freedom and GDP are significant factors influencing net migration patterns.
- Explore any additional interplay with conflicts, economic variables, and migration.
- Provide a comprehensive analysis to answer key questions about migration trends.

## Hypothesis
We believe there is a statistically significant relationship between migration patterns and a country’s economic conditions, specifically economic freedom and GDP. 

## Key Definitions

1. **Net Migration**: The difference between immigration (inflow) and emigration (outflow) of people in a country over a specific period.
2. **Immigration**: The process by which individuals move into a country with the intent of residing there.
3. **Emigration**: The act of leaving one’s country of residence to live in another.
4. **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**: The total monetary or market value of all finished goods and services produced within a country in a specific time period.
5. **Economic Freedom**: The ability of individuals and businesses to make economic decisions in a free and fair market environment, typically measured by factors such as property rights, freedom from corruption, tax burden, and regulatory efficiency.
   
## Analysis Methodology

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Raw data will be compiled, detailing net migration, economic freedom, and GDP for selected countries over a defined time frame.
   - Data will then be imported into Python using Pandas for cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis.
2. **Visualization**:
   - Graphs and charts will be created using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries to visualize the relationships between net migration, economic freedom, and GDP.
   - Negative values in net migration will represent net emigration, while positive values represent net immigration.
3. **Question Formation**:
   - How does economic freedom correlate with net migration patterns over time?
   - Does a country’s GDP significantly impact its migration trends?
   - Is there an interplay between economic freedom and GDP that jointly influences migration patterns?

## Deliverables

- A comprehensive report analyzing migration patterns in relation to economic freedom and GDP.
- Graphs and visualizations illustrating key trends and findings, generated using Python.
- Insights and answers to the proposed questions guiding this analysis.
